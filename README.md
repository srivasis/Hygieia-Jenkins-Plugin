# Hygieia-Jenkins-Plugin

This repo holds the Hygieia Jenkins plugin that needs to be modified to display additional options for Build Step on the Jenkins website for configuration.
Need to modify the options provided during the build step which currently only has a dropdown for status, to display an additional textbox input for "Application Name".
This application name will then be used to filter builds on the Hygieia Dashboard.
